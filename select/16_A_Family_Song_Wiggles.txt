I work all day with my pick and shovel.
I work in the sun, I always wear a hat.
I have two pets a fish and a cat.
I work all day for our local zoo.
I look after the monkeys and the koalas too.
I work in the sun, I always wear a hat.
I have two pets a fish and a cat.
After work, we meet back at our home.
I'm Mum.
I'm Dad.
And I'm Jerome.
When I work in the sun, I always wear a hat.
I love Mum and Dad our fish and our cat.
