There's got to be some folks around
With memories just like mine
Who'd give the world to stop the clock
And turn back the hands of time

To an evenin' spent like so many spent
With mom and dad at home
When dad would get the old guitar down
And sing a family song

Sing a family song, sing a family song
When mom and me sang harmony, little sister, she hummed along
Sing a family song, oh, sing a family song
When dad would get the old guitar down and sing a family song

Now maybe at first your memories of home
Won't resemble mine at all
But there's one thing I know we all have in common
And that's the God given gift to recall

Maybe your dad didn't play no guitar
But I know that there was somethin' he did
That doesn't make your old heart just well up and sad
When you relive your life as a kid

Sing a family song, oh, sing a family song
When mom and me sang harmony, little sister hummed along
Sing a family song, oh, sing a family song
When dad would get the old guitar down and we'd sing a family song
When dad would get the old guitar down and sing a family song
