We have been saved
For these latter days
We have been made
To follow His way
There may be times
We might turn in despair
But He is always there
We will go on
And we will not fall
And we will not run
We will be strong
Through the darkest night
We'll stand and fight
Through the deepest pain
Our love remains
And we will go on
This battle of life
Rages outside
So we face the storm
We're ready to ride
And there may be times
We must stand on our own
But we are never alone
We will go on
And we will not fall
And we will not run
We will be strong
Through the darkest night
We'll stand and fight
Through the deepest pain
Our love remains
And we will go on
The day will come when we will be with Him again
But until then
We must go on
And we cannot fall
And we cannot run
We must be strong
Through the darkest night
We'll stand and fight
Through the deepest pain
Love will remain
And we will go on
We will go on
We will go on
