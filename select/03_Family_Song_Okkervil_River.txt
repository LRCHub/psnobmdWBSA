Walk out in the street tonight
All the people asleep tonight
Feel the world 'neath your feet tonight
Cousin of mine
Cousin of mine

Won't you stand up and shine tonight?
Ring the world like a chime tonight
Break the roof on your climb tonight
Sister of mine
Sister of mine

Gone is your emergency anchor
Gone is your court upon high
Gone is your legal protector
You've got to protect yourself tonight
Protect whoever else is by you

Won't you go out and win, alright?
And won't you go out and lose? That's fine
And won't you go out and choose your life?
Lover of mine
Lover of mine

Gone is your father, the fighter
Holding his radiant prize
Gone is the clandestine lover
And the close friend who took his own life
We made it, though, to this moment in time

Gone are our layers of armor
Gone are rules that kept killers' hands tied
There are men who would do us all harm
But there are friends who would fight at our side
Even more friends and they all know what's right

So don't you know that you're seen, alright?
And won't you wake from your dream tonight?
Won't you know some true peace in time?
Enemy of mine
Enemy of mine

You're alive, I'm alive
You're alive, I'm alive
You're alive, I'm alive
You're alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
Alive, alive
Alive, alive
